The voting eligible population is an estimate of those eligible to vote in an election.

Of course, historical turnout rates are challenged in that they are calculated from election results with accuracy challenges.
The historical voting-eligible population is calculated from estimates of classes of enfranchised populations that are as 
accurate as may be. With these caveats, these historical turnout rates are regarded as the most accurate available.

The pre-1948 numbers are taken from Vital Statistics of American Politics (CQ Press, Stanley and Niemi, eds.).
Turnout rates from 1948-present are from vaious years reported on the data archive.

Pre-1948 turnout rates are from Walter Dean Burnham, to whom I and many others are deeply indebted.
