    "## The Independent Variable X (Theoretical Conjecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "Electoral turnout can have many definitions, such as the proportion of eligible voters who actually cast their ballots(). In the US, electoral turnout is often theorized to be positively related to electoral competitiveness for several reasons. In highly competitive elections where the outcome is uncertain, political parties and candidates are motivated to mobilize their supporters and increase voter turnout to secure victory. This can lead to greater efforts in voter registration and canvassing. These activities tend to generate more media attention, public discourse, and political debates, which may increase voter engagement and motivation to participate in the electoral process. In closely contested races especially, individuals may perceive their votes as having a greater impact on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to consider alternative hypotheses and potential pitfalls. While there may be a correlation between electoral competitiveness and turnout, it's essential to recognize that correlation does not imply causation. Other unobserved factors, such as demographic characteristics, political culture, or historical trends, could drive both variables independently. In such case, these variables are both driven by something in the model that is not accounted for (endogeneity). We can also consider a non-linear relationship between electoral competitiveness and turnout. For example, increased competitiveness may initially lead to higher turnout rates, but beyond a certain threshold, further increases in competitiveness may have diminishing returns on turnout as voters may feel overwhelmed or disengaged by highly contentious campaigns. This can take place within the same electoral season, or may even happen over the course of years, which indicates the potential for both variables to have a temporal lag effect on each other.  \n",

    "## Operationalization of X\n",
    "This project will explore the correlation between electoral competitiveness and turnout. The data for electoral turnout was sourced from University of Florida's Election Lab (McDonald), which defines electoral turnout as the proportion of the voting eligible population (VEP) that actually votes in an election. They further define VEP as an estimate of those eligible to vote in an election, calculated by the voting-age population minus ineligible non-citizens and felons (McDonald). As there is no national central agency that provides electoral statistics, a University publication was one of the next best credible sources to turn to. This dataset contains turnout rates for both presidential and midterm elections from 1789 - 2020. To measure electoral turnout from this data, only data for presidential election turnouts will be used, as the polling average data is also limited to presidential elections. Additionally, only data from 1972-2016 will be used, as this is the time span measured in the polling average data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One shortfall of this operationalization of electoral turnout is that the data are national aggregates, not data for each state. There was no information found on how each state's turnout contributed to the national turnout average. This may undermine the procedure taken in operationalizing electoral competitiveness to account for the differences in population and assigned electoral votes related to each state. For electoral competitiveness, daily candidate poll ratings per state were aggregated from April 9th to election day, as this was the earliest data collection date all election years had in common. The states were then grouped into 9 geographic divisions based on Census Regions, and each region was given a weighting based on the number of electoral votes of all its comprising states. National polling ratings per election were calculated as weighted averages of divisional ratings, and the standard deviation of these ratings served as a measure of election competitiveness.\n",
